"""OfficeQA answer check: the submitted answer against gold, with scale, sign and list length.

The vendored matcher (``answer_match``) compares bare numbers, so it accepts "543 billion"
for "543 million" and rejects "543000000"; it reads "-$1,299 million" as a positive 1,299;
and it accepts any number in the answer that equals gold, extra list items included.
Numeric golds are compared here instead. Golds with words in them (names, dates) keep the
vendored matcher, which checks the words as well.

An answer must state its final value or values, alone. A single value must lead the
answer: everything from the first explanation marker on is working, and figures there do
not count. A list may carry parenthetical asides between its items, which do not count
either.
